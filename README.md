## DevOps Python Mini Projects

This repository contains three small Python scripts that cover common DevOps use cases. These scripts are written in a simple and readable way and can be easily understood and modified by beginners.

## Q1. Password Strength Checker
Description

In DevOps, security is very important, and one of the basic security practices is using strong passwords. This script checks whether a given password meets standard strength requirements.

## Features

Checks minimum password length (at least 8 characters)

Verifies presence of both uppercase and lowercase letters

Ensures at least one digit (0–9)

Ensures at least one special character (such as ! @ # $ %)

Returns a boolean result and gives clear feedback to the user

## How It Works

The script defines a function called check_password_strength() which takes the password as input and validates it against the defined rules. The user is prompted to enter a password, and the script displays whether the password is strong or weak along with the reason.
